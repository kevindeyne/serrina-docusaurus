Elesgate is the largest city in the continent. It is a vast, diverse maze of gothic streets, wooden shacks and gigantic citadels. It is not controlled by a single House, instead each district has different influences.

## Current events
 
Currently, Elesgate is hit by a terrible plague. Some of the districts are closed down. Doctors from all over the world are arriving to combat this disease. In addition to this, several armies are stationed in border districts on their way from various war fronts.

## Architecture

Elesgate is made up of large, dynamic, districts consisting out of sprawling streets with tight housing. The one richer district is made up of stone housing and is elevated. Stone is also used for the citadels and the defensive walls. The poorer districts are constructed out of wooden shacks.
 
Each district has a single massive citadel. As the districts are not truly legislative and completely dynamic, they are essentially just a sphere of influence projection from the citadel owners. Ownership of these citadels shifts over the years a lot through political deals.
