Ironhold is a isolated citystate. It refuses any diplomatic treaties and no visitors are allowed to the citystate. Their city is essentially built onto a mountain, with massive walls that have never been penetrated before. Circling around the city's mountain are long stretching grass fields.
 
After a failed attempt at unifying the border zones and losing all of its territory except for the capital, Ironhold abandoned its expansionist policies and looked to avoid future conflict in the interest of self-preservation. For the attacking parties, this was acceptable, as Ironhold would serve as a valuable buffer zone between X and Y and contribute to stability in the region. During 1815’s Congress of Vienna, they signed a declaration affirming Ironhold's “neutrality”.
