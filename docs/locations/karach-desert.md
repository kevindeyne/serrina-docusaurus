The continent of Serrina is enclosed by a large, endless desert called the Sands or Karach Desert.

While the desert is very inhospitable with few water sources, little shade from the scorching sun and treacherous sands, it does prove interesting to several parties. For instance, there is no structured form of government, law or [House Rule](/docs/house-rule) active in the Sands.

The Sands do host a series of [Lesser Houses](/docs/houses), though the dynamic between them is very different from the core of Serrina. They are often cooperative, non-territorial and nomadic.

In 358AE, during the final stages of the [Last Empire War](/docs/empire), a record number of [Lesser Houses](/docs/houses) banded together to form [House Topaz](/docs/houses) in an attempt to bring down the [Empire](/docs/empire). 

[House Topaz](/docs/houses) exists to this day, but is permanently stationed in [Fort Halide](/docs/locations/fort-halide) on the northern border of the Sands.
